		<!-- Here is a quick coding challenge. 

        We just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems within a given time limit.
        
        You will have 2 hours to complete this. Starting with the time that the test was sent to you. 
        
        We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. -->

		<!-- https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers  -->
		<!-- Documentation for this API: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2  -->

		<!-- We would like you to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to read the
		API and display it in an organized way. You do not have
		to display all of the information that the API provides.
		Find a balanced way to display as much information as
		possible without compromising the user experience. As a
		bonus feature (not required), you should add in some
		sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Please code
		this from scratch or feel free to use any frameworks you
		would like to achieve the task. Please know the test
		will be scored on good use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
		NOT in how well you know the framework. Get creative!
		How to submit Please upload the code for this project to
		GitHub, and post a link to your repository below. You
		should at least have a HTML file.  -->
